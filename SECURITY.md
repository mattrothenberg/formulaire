## How releases are protected

- `formulaire-ui` is published only by `.github/workflows/release.yml`, through npm
  [trusted publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers) (OIDC). There
  are no npm tokens in this repository, and the package disallows token publishing.
- The trusted publisher is limited to [staged publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/staged-publishing),
  and to the `npm` GitHub environment, which only a maintainer can approve and only
  from `main`. A release needs two approvals: the environment in GitHub, then the
  staged version on npm, with 2FA.
- Workflows start with no permissions, pin every action to a commit SHA, and pin the
  npm CLI version. Dependencies resolve only to versions published at least three
  days earlier (`minimumReleaseAge`), and dependency install scripts are off by default.
- `main` can't be force-pushed or deleted, and release tags can't be moved or deleted.
